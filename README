vs_query.py:
input: python3 vs_query.py [database_dir] [k] [scores] [word1] [word2] [word3]

Tokenization:
I used stemming in this query however did not touch anything with the input of phrase search.
I cleaned all the punctuation marks of the word first, then if len(word)>= 4 remove 'es' and 's' but kept 'ss' at the end of the word 

ASSUMPTION:
assume database already existed on everything but create_index.py
